            At Little Lemon, we bring the warmth of the Mediterranean to the heart of Chicago.
            Our journey began with a passion for fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and a commitment
            to hospitality that feels like home.

            Whether you're stopping by for a quick lunch, a romantic dinner, or a family celebration,
            our menu offers something for everyone, from traditional favorites to creative seasonal specials.
